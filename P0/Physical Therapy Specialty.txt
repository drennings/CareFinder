Physical therapyPhysical therapy  PT   also known as physiotherapy  is a physical medicine and rehabilitation specialty that  by using mechanical force and movements  remediates impairments and promotes mobility  function  and quality of life through examination  diagnosis  prognosis  and physical intervention  It is performed by physical therapists  known as physiotherapists in many countries   In addition to clinical practice  other activities encompassed in the physical therapy profession include research  education  consultation  and administration  Physical therapy services may be provided alongside  or in conjunction with  other medical services       Overview    Physical therapy attempts to address the illnesses  or injuries that limit a person s abilities to move and perform functional activities in their daily lives  PTs use an individual s history and physical examination to arrive at a diagnosis and establish a management plan and  when necessary  incorporate the results of laboratory and imaging studies like X rays  CT scan  or MRI findings  Electrodiagnostic testing  e g   electromyograms and nerve conduction velocity testing  may also be used  PT management commonly includes prescription of or assistance with specific exercises  manual therapy and manipulation  mechanical devices such as traction  education  physical agents which includes heat  cold  electricity  sound waves  radiation  rays  prescription of assistive devices  prostheses  orthoses and other interventions  In addition  PTs work with individuals to prevent the loss of mobility before it occurs by developing fitness and wellness oriented programs for healthier and more active lifestyles  providing services to individuals and populations to develop  maintain and restore maximum movement and functional ability throughout the lifespan  This includes providing therapeutic treatment in circumstances where movement and function are threatened by aging  injury  disease or environmental factors  Functional movement is central to what it means to be healthy  Physical therapy is a professional career which has many specialties including sports  neurology  wound care  EMG  cardiopulmonary  geriatrics  orthopedics  women s health  and pediatrics  Neurological rehabilitation is in particular a rapidly emerging field  PTs practice in many settings  such as private owned physical therapy clinics  outpatient clinics or offices  health and wellness clinics  rehabilitation hospitals facilities  skilled nursing facilities  extended care facilities  private homes  education and research centers  schools  hospices  industrial and this workplaces or other occupational environments  fitness centers and sports training facilities  Physical therapists also practise in the non patient care roles such as health policy  health insurance  health care administration and as health care executives  Physical therapists are involved in the medical legal field serving as experts  performing peer review and independent medical examinations  Education varies greatly by country  The span of education ranges from some countries having little formal education to others having doctoral degrees and post doctoral residencies and fellowships       History     Physicians like Hippocrates and later Galen are believed to have been the first practitioners of physical therapy  advocating massage  manual therapy techniques and hydrotherapy to treat people in     BC  After the development of orthopedics in the eighteenth century  machines like the Gymnasticon were developed to treat gout and similar diseases by systematic exercise of the joints  similar to later developments in physical therapy  The earliest documented origins of actual physical therapy as a professional group date back to Per Henrik Ling   Father of Swedish Gymnastics   who founded the Royal Central Institute of Gymnastics  RCIG  in      for manipulation  and exercise  The Swedish word for physical therapist is sjukgymnast   someone involved in gymnastics for those who are ill  In       PTs were given official registration by Sweden s National Board of Health and Welfare  Other countries soon followed  In       four nurses in Great Britain formed the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy  The School of Physiotherapy at the University of Otago in New Zealand in       and the United States       Reed College in Portland  Oregon  which graduated  reconstruction aides   Since the profession s inception  spinal manipulative therapy has been a component of the physical therapist practice  Modern physical therapy was established towards the end of the   th century due to events that had an effect on a global scale  which called for rapid advances in physical therapy  Soon following American orthopedic surgeons began treating children with disabilities and began employing women trained in physical education  and remedial exercise  These treatments were applied and promoted further during the Polio outbreak of       During the First World War women were recruited to work with and restore physical function to injured soldiers  and the field of physical therapy was institutionalized  In      the term  Reconstruction Aide  was used to refer to individuals practicing physical therapy  The first school of physical therapy was established at Walter Reed Army Hospital in Washington  D C   following the outbreak of World War I  Research catalyzed the physical therapy movement  The first physical therapy research was published in the United States in March      in  The PT Review   In the same year  Mary McMillan organized the Physical Therapy Association  now called the American Physical Therapy Association  APTA   In       the Georgia Warm Springs Foundation promoted the field by touting physical therapy as a treatment for polio  Treatment through the     s primarily consisted of exercise  massage  and traction  Manipulative procedures to the spine and extremity joints began to be practiced  especially in the British Commonwealth countries  in the early     s  Around this time when polio vaccines were developed  physical therapists have become a normal occurrence in hospitals throughout North America and Europe  In the late     s  physical therapists started to move beyond hospital based practice to outpatient orthopedic clinics  public schools  colleges universities health centres  geriatric settings  skilled nursing facilities   rehabilitation centers and medical centers  Specialization for physical therapy in the U S  occurred in       with the Orthopaedic Section of the APTA being formed for those physical therapists specializing in orthopaedics  In the same year  the International Federation of Orthopaedic Manipulative Physical Therapists was formed  which has ever since played an important role in advancing manual therapy worldwide       Education     Educational criteria for physical therapy providers vary from state to state and from country to country  and among various levels of professional responsibility  Most U S  states have physical therapy practice acts that recognize both physical therapists  PT  and physical therapist assistants  PTA  and some jurisdictions also recognize physical therapy technicians  PT Techs  or aides  Most countries have licensing bodies that require physical therapists to be a member of before they can start practicing as independent professionals        Canada     Canadian Physiotherapy programs are offered at    Universities  often through the university s respective college of medicine  In the past decade  each of Canada s physical therapy schools has transitioned from   year Bachelor of Science in Physical Therapy  BScPT  programs that required   years of pre requisites university courses    year bachelor s degree  to   year Master s of Physical Therapy  MPT  programs that require pre requisite bachelor s degrees  The last Canadian university to follow suit was the University of Manitoba who transitioned to the MPT program in       making the MPT credential the new entry to practice standard across Canada  Existing practitioners with BScPT credentials are not required to upgrade their qualifications  In the province of Quebec  prospective physiotherapists are required to have completed a college diploma in either health sciences  which lasts on average two years  or physical rehabilitation technology  which lasts at least three years  to apply to a physiotherapy program or program in university  Following admission  physical therapy students work on a bachelor of science with a major in physical therapy and rehabilitation  The B Sc  usually requires three years to complete  Students must then enter graduate school to complete a master s degree in physical therapy  which normally requires one and a half to two years of study  Graduates who obtain their M Sc  must successfully pass the membership examination to become member of the Ordre professionnel de la physioth rapie du Qu bec  OPPQ   Physiotherapists can pursue their education in such fields as rehabilitation sciences  sports medicine  kinesiology  and physiology  In the province of Quebec  physical rehabilitation therapists are health care professionals who are required to complete a three year college diploma program in physical rehabilitation therapy and be member of the Ordre professionnel de la physioth rapie du Qu bec  OPPQ  in order to practise legally in the country  Most physical rehabilitation therapists complete their college diploma at Coll ge Montmorency  Dawson College  or C gep Marie Victorin  all situated in and around the Montreal area  After completing their technical college diploma  graduates have the opportunity to pursue their studies at the university level to perhaps obtain a bachelor s degree in physiotherapy  kinesiology  exercise science  or occupational therapy  The Universit  de Montr al  the Universit  Laval and the Universit  de Sherbrooke are among the Qu b cois universities that admit physical rehabilitation therapists in their programs of study related to health sciences and rehabilitation in order to credit courses that were completed in college  To date  there are no bridging programs available to facilitate upgrading from the BScPT to the MPT credential  However  research Master s of Science  MSc  and Doctor of Philosophy  PhD  programs are available at every university  Aside from academic research  practitioners can upgrade their skills and qualifications through continuing education courses and curriculums  Continuing education is a requirement of the provincial regulatory bodies  The Canadian Alliance of Physiotherapy Regulators  CAPR   or simply known as The Alliance  offers eligible program graduates to apply for the national Physiotherapy Competency Examination  PCE   Passing the PCE is one of the requirements in most provinces and territories to work as a licensed physiotherapist in Canada  The Alliance has members which are physiotherapy regulatory organizations recognized in their respective provinces and territories  Government of Yukon  Consumer Services College of Physical Therapists of British Columbia Physiotherapy Alberta College   Association Saskatchewan College of Physical Therapists College of Physiotherapists of Manitoba College of Physiotherapists of Ontario Ordre professionnel de la physioth rapie du Qu bec College of Physiotherapists of New Brunswick Coll ge des physioth rapeutes du Nouveau Brunswick Nova Scotia College of Physiotherapists Prince Edward Island College of Physiotherapists Newfoundland   Labrador College of Physiotherapists The Canadian Physiotherapy Association offers a curriculum of continuing education courses in orthopaedics and manual therapy  The program consists of   levels    courses  of training with ongoing mentorship and evaluation at each level  The orthopaedic curriculum and examinations takes a minimum of   years to complete  However  upon completion of level    physiotherapists can apply to a unique   year course based Master s program in advanced orthopaedics and manipulation at the University of Western Ontario to complete their training  This program accepts only    physiotherapists annually since       Successful completion of either of these education streams and their respective examinations allows physiotherapists the opportunity to apply to the Canadian Academy of Manipulative Physiotherapy  CAMPT  for fellowship  Fellows of the Canadian Academy of manipulative Physiotherapists  FCAMPT  are considered leaders in the field  having extensive post graduate education in orthopaedics and manual therapy  FCAMPT is an internationally recognized credential  as CAMPT is a member of the International Federation of Manipulative Physiotherapists  IFOMPT   a branch of the World Confederation of Physical Therapy  WCPT  and the World Health Organization  WHO          Scotland      Physiotherapy degrees are offered at three universities  Robert Gordon University in Aberdeen  Glasgow Caledonian University in Glasgow and Queen Margaret University in Edinburgh  Students can qualify as physiotherapists by completing a four year Bachelor of Science degree or a two year master s degree  if they already have an undergraduate degree in a related field   In order to use the title  Physiotherapist   a student must register with the Health and Care Professions Council  a UK wide regulatory body  on qualifying  Many physiotherapists are also members of the Chartered Society of Physiotherapists  CSP   who provides insurance and professional support         United States      The primary physical therapy practitioner is the Physical Therapist  PT  who is trained and licensed to examine  evaluate  diagnose and treat impairment  functional limitations and disabilities in patients or clients  Physical Therapist education curricula in the United States culminate in a Doctor of Physical Therapy  DPT  degree  but many currently practising PTs hold a Master of Physical Therapy degree  and some still hold a Bachelor s degree  Currently the education programs for physical therapy have changed  The Master of Physical Therapy and Master of Science in Physical Therapy degrees are no longer offered  and the entry level degree is the Doctor of Physical Therapy degree  which typically takes   years  PTs who hold a Masters or bachelors in PT are encouraged to get their DPT because APTA s goal is for all PT s to be on a doctoral level  WCPT recommends physical therapist entry level educational programs be based on university or university level studies  of a minimum of four years  independently validated and accredited  Curricula in the United States are accredited by the Commission on Accreditation in Physical Therapy Education  CAPTE   According to CAPTE  as of      there are        students currently enrolled in     accredited PT programs in the United States  Updated CAPTE statistics list that for            there are        students enrolled in     accredited PT programs in the United States  The physical therapist professional curriculum includes content in the clinical sciences  e g   content about the cardiovascular  pulmonary  endocrine  metabolic  gastrointestinal  genitourinary  integumentary  musculoskeletal  and neuromuscular systems and the medical and surgical conditions frequently seen by physical therapists   Current training is specifically aimed to enable physical therapists to appropriately recognize and refer non musculoskeletal diagnoses that may presently similarly to those caused by systems not appropriate for physical therapy intervention  which has resulted in direct access to physical therapists in many states  Post doctoral residency and fellowship education prevalence is increasing steadily with     residency  and    fellowship programs accredited in       Residencies are aimed to train physical therapists in a specialty such as acute care  cardiovascular   pulmonary  clinical electrophysiology  faculty  geriatrics  neurology  orthopaedics  pediatrics  sports  women s health  and wound care  whereas fellowships train specialists in a subspecialty  e g  critical care  hand therapy  and division   sports   similar to the medical model  Residency programs offer eligibility to sit for the specialist certification in their respective area of practice  For example  completion of an orthopaedic physical therapy residency  allows its graduates to apply and sit for the clinical specialist examination in orthopaedics  achieving the OCS designation upon passing the examination  Board certification of physical therapy specialists is aimed to recognize individuals with advanced clinical knowledge and skill training in their respective area of practice  and exemplifies the trend toward greater education to optimally treat individuals with movement dysfunction  Physical therapist assistants may deliver treatment and physical interventions for patients and clients under a care plan established by and under the supervision of a physical therapist  Physical therapist assistants in the United States are currently trained under associate of applied sciences curricula specific to the profession  as outlined and accredited by CAPTE  As of August       there were     accredited two year  Associate degree  programs for physical therapist assistants In the United States of America  According to CAPTE  as of      there are        students currently enrolled in     accredited PTA programs in the United States  Updated CAPTE statistics list that for            there are        students enrolled in     accredited PTA programs in the United States  Curricula for the physical therapist assistant associate degree include  Anatomy   physiology Exercise physiology Human biology Physics Biomechanics Kinesiology Neuroscience Clinical pathology Behavioral sciences Communication Ethics Research Other coursework as required by individual programs  Job duties and education requirements for Physical Therapy Technicians or Aides may vary depending on the employer  but education requirements range from high school diploma or equivalent to completion of a   year degree program  O Net reports that     of PT Aides Techs have a high school diploma or equivalent      have completed some college but do not hold a degree  and     hold an associate degree  Some jurisdictions allow physical therapists to employ technicians or aides or therapy assistants to perform designated routine tasks related to physical therapy under the direct supervision of a physical therapist  Some jurisdictions require physical therapy technicians or aides to be certified  and education and certification requirements vary among jurisdictions       Employment    Physical therapy related jobs in North America have shown rapid growth in recent years  but employment rates and average wages may vary significantly between different countries  states  provinces or regions        United States of America     According to the United States Department of Labor s Bureau of Labor Statistics  there were approximately         Physical Therapists employed in the United States in       earning an average         annually  or        per hour  with     growth in employment projected by the year       The Bureau of Labor Statistics also reports that there were approximately         Physical Therapist Assistants and Aides employed in the United States in       earning an average         annually  or        per hour  with     growth in employment projected by the year       To meet their needs  many healthcare and physical therapy facilities hire  Travel physical therapists   who work temporary assignments between   and    weeks for much higher wages  about          a year  Bureau of Labor Statistics data on PTAs and Techs can be difficult to decipher  due to their tendency to report data on these job fields collectively rather than separately  O Net reports that in       PTAs in the United States earned a median wage of         annually or        hourly  and that Aides Techs earned a median wage of         annually or        hourly in            Specialty areas    The body of knowledge of physical therapy is large  and therefore physical therapists may specialize in a specific clinical area  While there are many different types of physical therapy  the American Board of Physical Therapy Specialties lists nine current specialist certifications  the ninth  Oncology  pending for its first examination in       Most Physical Therapists practicing in a specialty will have undergone further training  such as an accredited residency program  although individuals are currently able to sit for their specialist examination after       hours of focused practice in their respective specialty population  in addition to requirements set by each respective specialty board        Cardiovascular   pulmonary physiotherapy     Cardiovascular and pulmonary rehabilitation respiratory practitioners and physical therapists offer therapy for a wide variety of cardiopulmonary disorders or pre and post cardiac or pulmonary surgery  An example of cardiac surgery is coronary bypass surgery  Primary goals of this specialty include increasing endurance and functional independence  Manual therapy is used in this field to assist in clearing lung secretions experienced with cystic fibrosis  Pulminary disorders  heart attacks  post coronary bypass surgery  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  and pulmonary fibrosis  treatments can benefit from cardiovascular and pulmonary specialized physical therapists        Clinical electrophysiology     This specialty area includes electrotherapy physical agents  electrophysiological evaluation  EMG NCV   physical agents  and wound management        Geriatric     Geriatric physical therapy covers a wide area of issues concerning people as they go through normal adult aging but is usually focused on the older adult  There are many conditions that affect many people as they grow older and include but are not limited to the following  arthritis  osteoporosis  cancer  Alzheimer s disease  hip and joint replacement  balance disorders  incontinence  etc  Geriatric physical therapists specialize in providing therapy for such conditions in older adults        Integumentary     Integumentary physical therapy includes the treatment of conditions involving the skin and all its related organs  Common conditions managed include wounds and burns  Physical therapists may utilize surgical instruments  wound irrigations  dressings and topical agents to remove the damaged or contaminated tissue and promote tissue healing  Other commonly used interventions include exercise  edema control  splinting  and compression garments  The work done by physical therapists in the integumentary specialty do work similar to what would be done by medical doctors or nurses in the emergency room or triage        Neurological     Neurological physical therapy is a field focused on working with individuals who have a neurological disorder or disease  These can include stroke  chronic back pain  Alzheimer s disease  Charcot Marie Tooth disease  CMT   ALS  brain injury  cerebral palsy  l g b  syndrome  multiple sclerosis  Parkinson s disease  facial palsy and spinal cord injury  Common impairments associated with neurologic conditions include impairments of vision  balance  ambulation  activities of daily living  movement  muscle strength and loss of functional independence  The techniques involve in neurological physical therapy are wide ranging and often require specialized training  Neurological physiotherapy is also called neurophysiotherapy or neurological rehabilitation        Orthopedic      Orthopedic physical therapists diagnose  manage  and treat disorders and injuries of the musculoskeletal system including rehabilitation after orthopedic surgery  acute trauma such as sprains  strains injuries of insidious onset such as tendinopathy  bursitis and deformities like scoliosis  This speciality of physical therapy is most often found in the out patient clinical setting  Orthopedic therapists are trained in the treatment of post operative orthopedic procedures  fractures  acute sports injuries  arthritis  sprains  strains  back and neck pain  spinal conditions  and amputations  Joint and spine mobilization manipulation  dry needling  similar to acupuncture   therapeutic exercise  neuromuscular techniques  muscle reeducation  hot cold packs  and electrical muscle stimulation  e g   cryotherapy  iontophoresis  electrotherapy  are modalities employed to expedite recovery in the orthopedic setting  Additionally  an emerging adjunct to diagnosis and treatment is the use of sonography for diagnosis and to guide treatments such as muscle retraining  Those who have suffered injury or disease affecting the muscles  bones  ligaments  or tendons will benefit from assessment by a physical therapist specialized in orthopedics        Pediatric     Pediatric physical therapy assists in early detection of health problems and uses a variety of modalities to provide physical therapy for disorders in the pediatric population  These therapists are specialized in the diagnosis  treatment  and management of infants  children  and adolescents with a variety of congenital  developmental  neuromuscular  skeletal  or acquired disorders diseases  Treatments focus mainly on improving gross and fine motor skills  balance and coordination  strength and endurance as well as cognitive and sensory processing integration        Sports     Physical therapists are closely involved in the care and wellbeing of athletes including recreational  semi professional  paid  and professional  full time employment  participants  This area of practice encompasses athletic injury management under   main categories  acute care   assessment and diagnosis of an initial injury  treatment   application of specialist advice and techniques to encourage healing  rehabilitation   progressive management for full return to sport  prevention   identification and address of deficiencies known to directly result in  or act as precursors to injury  such as movement assessment education   sharing of specialist knowledge to individual athletes  teams or clubs to assist in prevention or management of injury Physical therapists who work for professional sport teams often have a specialized sports certification issued through their national registering organisation  Most Physical therapists who practice in a sporting environment are also active in collaborative sports medicine programs too  See also  athletic trainers         Women s health     Women s health physical therapy mostly addresses women s issues related to the female reproductive system  child birth  and post partum  These conditions include lymphedema  osteoporosis  pelvic pain  prenatal and post partum periods  and urinary incontinence  It also addresses incontinence  pelvic pain  and other disorders associated with pelvic floor dysfunction  Manual physical therapy has been demonstrated in multiple studies to increase rates of conception in women with infertility        Palliative care     Physiotherapy in the field of oncology and palliative care is a continuously evolving and developing specialty  both in malignant and non malignant diseases  Rehabilitation for both groups of patients is now recognized as an essential part of the clinical pathway  as early diagnoses and new treatments are enabling patients to live longer  it is generally accepted that patients should have access to an appropriate level of rehabilitation  so that they can function at a minimum level of dependency and optimize their quality of life  regardless of their life expectancy       Effectiveness    A      systematic review found evidence to support the use of spine manipulation by physical therapists as a safe option to improve outcomes for low back pain  A      systematic review suggested that spine manipulation and therapeutic massage are effective interventions for neck pain  it also suggested  however  that electroacupuncture  strain counterstrain  relaxation massage  heat therapy and ultrasound therapy are not effective and thus not recommended for the treatment of neck pain       United States    Definitions and licensing requirements in the United States vary among jurisdictions  as each state has enacted its own physical therapy practice act defining the profession within its jurisdiction  but the American Physical Therapy Association  APTA  has also drafted a model definition in order to limit this variation  and the APTA is also responsible for accrediting physical therapy education curricula throughout the United States of America       See also    World Confederation for Physical Therapy American Board of Physical Therapy Specialties
